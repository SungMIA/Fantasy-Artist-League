# Fantasy-Artist-League
A web app that integrates Spotify API to pull artist/track data from new releases. Users try to predict the success of an album, and are given points/currency based on the artist's appearance/ranking on the weekly Billboard Top 100. 

Coding Goals:
Build Front-End with HTML/CSS/React.js/Bulma
Initialize, deploy Firebase

Types of data:
- Spotify API data for artists, tracks, new releases
- Web scraped data from Billboard Weekly Top 100 Artists
- User choices, account information/profiles, and global/local rankings. 

TODO with both types of data:
Integrate data into Firebase
Integrate React components with Firebase data

Javascript for calculating points on weekly basis

Startup Goals:
- Market research on whether or not idea is worth pursuing.
  - 1-2 Reddit Posts per day
- If idea gains traction:
  - Build demo on Figma
  - Create Social Media Campaign on Instagram
